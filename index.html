            Hi, my name is JavaScript. When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”. 
            But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help.
            But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no relation to Java at all.
